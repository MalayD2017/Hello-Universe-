# Hello-Universe-
New to programming yet, eager to learn. Any pointers?
Fun and obvious facts about myself my real name is not Malay. I'm just a fan of DnD. 
I have tribbles for sale but, you did'nt get them from me....(coughs clears throat and winks)
Lastly, while we're on the subject of games an sci-fi fantasy, these are currently relevent to the areas I'm intrested in.
What sort of projects should I work on towards understanding and building game/web development with literally no real programming experience? 
I'm a blank canvas or sponge like brain.... Please paint me or share information that I can soak up! Thank you
